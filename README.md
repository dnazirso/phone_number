Phone Numbers kata

==================



Given a list of phone numbers, determine if it is consistent. In a consistent phone list no number is a prefix of another. 



### For example:

* Bob: 91 12 54 26

* Alice: 97 625 992

* Emergency: 911



In this case, it is not possible to call Bob because the phone exchange would direct your call to the emergency line as soon as you as dialed the first three digits of Bob’s phone number.
